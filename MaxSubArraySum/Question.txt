  In this challenge, given an array of integers, the goal is to efficiently
  find
  the subarray that has the greatest value when
  all
  of its elements are summed together.  Note that because some elements of the
  array may be negative, the problem is not solved by simply picking the
  start
  and end elements of the array to be the subarrray, and summing the entire
  array. 
  <br><br>
  For example, given the array
  </p>
  {1, 2, -5, 4, -3, 2}
  </pre>
  The maximum sum of a subarray is 4.  It is possible for the subarray to be
  zero elements in length (if every element of the array were negative).

  Before you write the code, take some time to think of the most efficient
  solution possible; it may surprise you.  The major goal of this challenge is
  to
  test your algorithmic skills rather than merely your ability to write code
  quickly.
